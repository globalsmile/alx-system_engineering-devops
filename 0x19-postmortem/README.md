# Web Stack Outage Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration of the Outage:**
  - Start Time: October 15, 2023, 14:30 UTC
  - End Time: October 15, 2023, 16:45 UTC

- **Impact:**
  - The outage affected the primary web application service.
  - Users experienced complete unavailability during the incident.
  - Approximately 80% of users were affected.

- **Root Cause:**
  - The root cause of the outage was identified as an unanticipated surge in database connections, leading to resource exhaustion.

## Timeline

- **Detection Time:**
  - October 15, 2023, 14:30 UTC

- **Detection Method:**
  - Monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates and response time.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - The incident response team initiated an immediate investigation into the performance metrics of the web application and underlying infrastructure.
  - Assumed root cause to be a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden traffic surge.
  - Investigated network logs, firewalls, and load balancers to identify malicious patterns.
  - No evidence of a DDoS attack found.

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Focused initially on network-related issues, diverting attention from the actual problem.
  - Considered potential issues with CDN and caching layers.
  - Temporary downscale of web servers was attempted, worsening the situation.

- **Escalation:**
  - Incident was escalated to the database administration team and senior DevOps engineers.

- **Resolution:**
  - Identified the root cause as an unexpected increase in database connections due to a code deployment that had not been optimized for efficient connection handling.
  - Implemented a rollback of the recent code deployment to a stable version.
  - Executed a controlled restart of the web servers and database instances.
  - Monitored the system to ensure stable performance before re-enabling traffic.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause Explanation:**
  - The surge in database connections was caused by a code change that opened new connections for each request without proper connection pooling. This resulted in exhausting the available database connections.

- **Resolution Details:**
  - Rolled back to the previous version of the code where the connection pooling was implemented efficiently.
  - Conducted a thorough code review to identify the specific changes that led to the oversight.
  - Implemented a quick hotfix to optimize connection handling without affecting the overall functionality of the application.
  - Increased monitoring on database connection metrics to detect potential issues proactively.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Enhance the pre-deployment testing process to include performance checks related to database connection handling.
  - Implement stricter code review practices to catch potential performance bottlenecks.
  - Establish clear communication channels between development and operations teams to quickly identify and address deployment-related issues.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire codebase to identify any similar inefficiencies in connection handling.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting specifically for database-related metrics.
  - Organize cross-team workshops to improve collaboration during incident response.
  - Develop and document best practices for efficient connection handling in the codebase.
